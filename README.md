# Project Title : TIC-TAC-TOE Game

Assignment : https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. I used Rspec framework to test the correct functioning of the game.  
Also, Notes that you can choose the size of the board in the range [3..10]
